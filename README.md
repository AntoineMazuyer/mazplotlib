# MazPlotLib

Easy and tweakable python tools to draw plots.

## Disclaimer
This is a _work in progress_ project that compiles tools that I use during my PhD to easy draw plots
from CSV style files. It is certainly not complete and not robust to all the (bad) things you can 
do with it.

## Dependencies

 * Python 2.7
 * Matplotlib

## File Description

 * mazplotlib.py : Contains all the function to be called to draw plots
 * tools.py      : Contains some useful functions for mazplotlib
 * main.py       : Contains some examples to quickly test mazplotlib

 There is a data folder with some dumb files to test the library
